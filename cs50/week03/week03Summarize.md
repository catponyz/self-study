## What I Learned:
* I finally learned what symbols such as O, Î© and Î˜ mean in coding.
* I learned about sorting algorithms and the time complexity differences between them.
* Recursive functions can be much more efficient than regular ones.
* If you change a global variable within a function, it will change the global variable itselfâ€”because you're directly accessing the same memory location.
* You can define your own data type using the struct data structure.


## Challenges
* Understanding merge sort.
