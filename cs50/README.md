# CS50 Independent Study
This folder in my self-study repository contains my solutions and notes from Harvardâ€™s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science, which I'm completing over the summer after finishing my freshman year at university.

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This
Considering that, the only Computer Science course we've covered in university this year was Intro to Python, I already feel left behind from most of the students all around the world. I felt the need to self study to be ahead and become *Tony Stark* :D.

## Progress
