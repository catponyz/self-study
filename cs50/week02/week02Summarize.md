## What I Learned:
* It is possible to receive input through command-line arguments. The element at index 0 is always the name of the file.
* The number of elements in an array must be declared beforehand.
* The type of elements should be the same within the same array.
* Strings are arrays of chars. Unlike Python, the elements of a string can be modified.
* Chars and integers are treated same. You an perform arithmetic operations between char and int types.
* The end of strings are defined with NUL.
* It is possible to define two variables within the loop declaration.
* In order to compare strings, you have to use "strcmp()".
* The errors we get in chrome (like *error404*) are defined by programmers by Exit Status, which means they're not random numbers.

## Challanges
* Understanding command-line arguments.
* Solving the problemset, which required managing multiple exit statuses.
